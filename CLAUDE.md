# Executive Assistant Framework

  Project to build a self-bootstrapping AI command centre.

  ## What This Is
  A framework that onboards any executive through conversation and generates its own CLAUDE.md, skills, workflows, agents, and hooks.

  ## Constraints
  - British English
  - Minimal complexity
  - Observable verification criteria in all workflows
  - Blog-article quality code and documentation

  ## Key Files
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design
  - `examples/` - Templates for skills, workflows, agents, hooks
  - `.claude/bootstrap/` - Onboarding system (being built)

  ## Not To Confuse
  This CLAUDE.md describes the *framework project*. The framework *generates different* CLAUDE.md files for end users based on their onboarding answers.
