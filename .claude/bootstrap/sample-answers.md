## Preferences

- **Focus time:** Mornings (8:30-11am) for deep work, no meetings
- **Response expectations:** Slack within 2 hours during work hours, email within 24 hours

### Self-Awareness

- **Needs help with:** Staying on top of admin tasks, remembering to update stakeholders after decisions, preparing for board meetings
- **Known blind spots:** Sometimes move too fast without bringing everyone along, can be too direct in written feedback
- **Frustrations:** Long-winded explanations, meetings without agendas, decisions revisited after they're made
- **Never do:** Schedule meetings before 9am or after 5pm, use corporate jargon, add calendar items without context
